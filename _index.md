## Summary

This MSc project presents the development of an Asset Import and Preparation Pipeline Tool designed specifically for Autodesk Maya. The tool automates batch import of various asset formats (FBX, OBJ, MA, MB, USD, etc.), performs cleanup tasks such as namespace merging and empty group removal, supports USD layers and variant browsing, and offers interactive UI features for scale adjustment and progress tracking.The objective is to enhance efficiency and consistency in asset handling workflows, integrating industry-standard USD support and enabling artists to focus more on creative tasks.
