# Maya Asset Import and Scene Preparation Tool

## Overview
This project aims to develop an integrated pipeline tool for Autodesk Maya to automate asset import, enforce consistent standards, and improve production efficiency. The tool will support any file format Maya can read (FBX, Alembic, USD, MA, MB) and provide an intuitive user interface for managing import and cleanup workflows.

## Objectives
- Batch import of multiple assets
- Automatic enforcement of naming conventions
- Namespace management
- Scene cleanup (empty groups, unused nodes, construction history)
- Texture path validation and repair
- User-friendly interface using PySide2

## Status
- Requirements definition: In progress
- Prototype scripts: Not started
- UI design: Not started

## Next Steps
- Document Maya’s native features and pain points (docs/maya_native_features.md)
- Define problem statement (docs/problem_statement.md)
- …
