./setup.sh
```

### Post-Setup: Launching the Tool in Maya

After running the script:

1. Open Maya.
2. Go to **Script Editor â†’ Python** tab.
3. Paste and run the following command (update the path if necessary):

```python
exec(open('/your/full/path/to/install_shelf_button.py').read())
```

This will create a shelf button in Maya. Click the button to launch the Asset Import & Preparation Tool.
