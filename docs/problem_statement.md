## Problem Statement

While Autodesk Maya offers standard tools for importing and cleaning up assets, it does **not** support streamlined batch workflows or enforce consistent pipeline rules out of the box.
Artists are forced to manually repeat tedious tasks such as importing files one by one, managing namespaces, and repairing broken file paths. This manual process is inefficient, prone to human error, and does not scale well for large asset libraries or collaborative projects.
